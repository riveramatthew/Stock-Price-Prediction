## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Data Issues
❌ **Random train/test split** → Use temporal split
❌ **Looking into the future** → No data leakage
❌ **Ignoring missing values** → Handle explicitly
❌ **Not scaling features** → Critical for neural networks

### Modeling Issues
❌ **Overfitting** → Use cross-validation
❌ **Ignoring baseline** → Always compare to simple model
❌ **Too complex models** → Start simple, add complexity
❌ **Not tuning hyperparameters** → Can improve 10-20%

### Documentation Issues
❌ **No README** → Repository looks unprofessional
❌ **No comments** → Code is hard to understand
❌ **Vague results** → Be specific with numbers
❌ **No visualizations** → Show, don't just tell

### Blog Post Issues
❌ **Too technical** → Explain concepts clearly
❌ **No context** → Why does this problem matter?
❌ **Missing limitations** → Always discuss what didn't work
❌ **No visuals** → Break up text with charts

🚀 **Test frequently** - catch bugs early

### Code Quality
✨ **Use type hints** - improves readability
✨ **Write docstrings** - future you will thank you
✨ **Follow PEP 8** - consistent style matters
✨ **Use meaningful names** - not `df1`, `df2`, etc.

### Analysis
📊 **Visualize early and often** - understand your data
📊 **Start simple** - baseline before complexity
📊 **Question results** - if it seems too good, investigate
📊 **Compare to benchmark** - how good is "good"?

### Writing
📝 **Write for your audience** - technical but clear
📝 **Tell a story** - problem → solution → results
📝 **Use concrete examples** - not just abstractions
📝 **Edit ruthlessly** - less is more
